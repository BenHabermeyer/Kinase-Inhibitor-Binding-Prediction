# Kinase-Inhibitor-Binding-Prediction
Synapse Dream Competition Pairwise Deep Learning Predictor for Kinase Inhibitor Binding

Code and trimmed data file for my CIS192 Python Programming final project. Entered the Synapse Dream Competition for kinase inhibitor binding prediction. I developed a pairwise deep learning method to use kernels of protein kinase domain amino acid sequences and chemical compound SMILES sequences to produce a regression output for the pKD value representing a paired binding affinity between the two.

Data was taken from drug target commons and cleaned in one file. The second contains the pairwise learning methods I used.
